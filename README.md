pyhack
======

A simple ASCII roguelike written in Python.

This should work with Python 2.7+ and 3+. 

This program requires the 'yaml' module (e.g., apt-get install python-yaml (or python3-yaml))

The field-of-vision and pathfinding algorithms are implemented in C. See the maptool-build.sh file for build instructions.
